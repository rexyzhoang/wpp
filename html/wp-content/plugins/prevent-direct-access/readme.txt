A simple way to prevent search engines and the public from indexing and accessing your files without user authentication.

== Description ==
Prevent Direct Access is simple way to prevent search engines and the public from indexing and accessing your files without user authentication.

This plugin has the following functionalities:
= Protect Unlimited Uploaded Files =
Prevent Direct Access is designed to protect your files such as images, pdf or video that you upload via WordPress Media or Post.

Once protected, they cannot be accessed directly on the server. An error message will appear if others attempt to read and download these files.
= Generate Private URL =
Once a file is protected, the plugin will automatically generate a private URL containing random string for users to access the file. This private URL is the ONLY way to access the protected file.

Users can copy that private URL to clipboard and subsequently  pasting it on their browsers or email by clicking on the “Copy URL” button.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why nothing happens after I activate the plugin? =
First, the plugin only supports Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") at the moment. If you’re not using it, you may consider switching to httpd as it has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April 1996.

Second, the plugin also needs to flush some mod_rewrite rules to your website’s .htaccess file to prevents direct access to your files on the server. In order for the plugin to work properly, you must either make the .htaccess file (located on your website root folder) writable or manually update our mod_rewrite rules to your htaccess.
= Why do I see the popup box that says I can protect only 3 files? =
The free version of this plugin offers protection to 3 files only. Contact us at hello@buildwps.com for the premium version, which offer unlimited protected files and other premium features.
